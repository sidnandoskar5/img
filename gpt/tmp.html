                    <p>Last year, Tata Motors entered the passenger car <span class="info">CNG</span> segment with the Tiago CNG and Tigor CNG. While both cars offer a good mix of performance and efficiency, they also suffer from the same issue as every other CNG car in the market, which is limited boot space. However, Tata Motors have come up with a solution to address this issue. They debuted their latest twin CNG cylinder technology in the form of the Punch CNG and Altroz CNG at the 2023 <span class="info" >Auto Expo</span>. Here is everything you need to know about the twin CNG cylinder technology.</p>
                    <h3>Tata Punch, Altroz CNG With Twin CNG Cylinder</h3>
                    <p>To solve the issue of limited boot space, Tata Motors have split the big 60L CNG tank into 2 small 30L CNG tanks. This way, they are able to pack the 2 small cylinders underneath the boot floor, hence liberating more storage space than any other CNG car in the market. However, this has resulted in a new location for the spare wheel, which is now placed underneath the car. Thanks to the twin CNG cylinder tech, both the Altroz and Punch CNG offer 150L boot space, the highest among any CNG hatchbacks sold in the country.</p>
                    <p>While both the Altroz and Punch CNG share their powertrain with the Tiago and Tigor CNG, they offer more power and <span class="info">torque</span>. Both cars produce 75PS of power and 97Nm of torque, which is 2PS and 2Nm more than the Tiago CNG. The Tiago CNG produces 73PS of power and 95Nm of torque. This engine comes mated to a 5-speed <span class="info">manual transmission</span>. We do not expect Tata Motors to launch the Punch and Altroz CNG with an automatic transmission.</p>
                    <p>Going by the price structure of the Tiago and Tigor CNG, Tata Motors are likely to charge a premium of Rs. 90,000 for the CNG variants over the Altroz petrol and Punch petrol. Tata Motors will announce the prices of the Altroz and Punch CNG in the coming months. The Altroz CNG will go up against the Maruti Suzuki Baleno CNG and Toyota Glanza CNG whereas the Punch CNG will not have any direct rival at launch. </p>
